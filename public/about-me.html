      <div class="bio-section">
         <p>
            I am an <strong>Experienced Digital Product Owner</strong> with a 
            <strong>strong technical background</strong> and over <strong><span id="experienceYears"></span> years 
            of experience</strong> leading <strong>software development projects</strong> 
            across various industries, including <strong>motor insurance</strong>, 
            <strong>SaaS</strong>, and <strong>healthcare</strong>. My core expertise 
            lies in <strong>product strategy</strong>, <strong>agile methodologies</strong>, 
            and <strong>cross-functional collaboration</strong>, enabling me to deliver 
            <strong>data-driven solutions</strong> that consistently improve both 
            <strong>user experience</strong> and business outcomes.
         </p>
      
         <p>
            I excel at building and executing <strong>product roadmaps</strong> that align 
            with business goals, market demands, and user needs. Through 
            <strong>data analytics</strong>, <strong>market research</strong>, and ongoing 
            <strong>stakeholder engagement</strong>, I ensure that product enhancements 
            are innovative, efficient, and geared toward optimizing 
            <strong>user-centric experiences</strong>. My strong understanding of 
            <strong>user experience (UX) principles</strong> allows me to work closely 
            with <strong>UX/UI design teams</strong>, crafting seamless and intuitive 
            products that drive user satisfaction.
         </p>
      
         <p>
            With my hands-on approach to <strong>technical leadership</strong>, I guide 
            development teams through complex challenges, ensuring timely and 
            <strong>high-quality product deliveries</strong>. I actively engage in 
            <strong>technical discussions</strong> and bridge the gap between business 
            requirements and technical implementation, fostering clear communication and 
            alignment across teams.
         </p>
      
         <p>
            As a leader, I am passionate about building <strong>high-performing teams</strong> 
            that are <strong>diverse</strong> and <strong>collaborative</strong>. I cultivate 
            an environment where <strong>innovation</strong> and 
            <strong>continuous improvement</strong> thrive, empowering teams to take 
            ownership and drive success. My ability to manage diverse stakeholders, both 
            internal and external, ensures that every product delivers maximum impact, from 
            ideation to launch and beyond.
         </p>
      
         <p>
            I'm driven by a commitment to excellence and a passion for creating 
            <strong>user-centric products</strong> that meet business goals while solving 
            real-world challenges.
